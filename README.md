# MakeAndUploadFiles â€“ Distributed File Creation and S3 Upload System

This Node.js/TypeScript-based application simulates generation of large files and uploads them to an AWS S3 bucket in a distributed fashion using RabbitMQ and Docker containers.

## ðŸ§© Architecture Overview

- **App1**: Orchestrator. Accepts the `MakeAndUploadFiles` task and publishes `MakeUploadFile` jobs to RabbitMQ.
- **App2**: Worker nodes (scalable) that listen to the queue and perform file creation + upload to S3.
- **RabbitMQ**: Message broker to dispatch and manage upload jobs.
- **Docker Compose**: Orchestrates all containers.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Parallel file creation and upload
- Custom input parameters (file size/count/path)
- AWS S3 integration
- RabbitMQ-based task distribution
- Full VS Code Docker debugging support
